### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

@tunip3 made me do this. You can talk about their cat to them if you want.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on reversing the GXC.gg service.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing in particular
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cat petting
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C++ and possibly C#
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about GameMaker/C++ or cats (felines)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me:
    - Discord nik#5351,
    - E-Mail whatever@nkrapivindev.ddns.net,
    - VK vk.com/nkrapivindev
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/meow
- âš¡ Fun fact: cats are cute and there's nothing you can do about it.
